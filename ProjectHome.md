This is a simple implementation of Arkanoid for Android devices. It's my first development attempt for the Android platform, so probably riddled with bugs and bad programming practice.

Ideally, develop with the Eclipse ADT stuff.

Here is a screenshot of ArkaDroid running in the Android SDK:

Good start...
